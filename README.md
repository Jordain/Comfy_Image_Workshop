## ComfyUI Installation

2. If you already have git installed then download [scripts/install-manager-for-portable-version.bat](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager/raw/main/scripts/install-manager-for-portable-version.bat) and place into `"ComfyUI_windows_portable"` directory:

3. Then double click `install-manager-for-portable-version.bat` batch file

## Comfy Image Workshop Installation

1. Install this repo in your root user directory(C:\Users\\%username%). Open git bash

	git clone https://github.com/Jordain/Comfy_Image_Workshop.git

2. Go to the directory C:\Users\\%username%\\Comfy_Image_Workshop then crtl + shift + left click in a blank space and select open with PowerShell or CMD. Then run the following two commands

	python -m venv venv
	.\\.venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install all dependencies

	pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Intialize the db using these three commands

	flask db init
	flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
	flask db upgrade

5. To access CIW from other devices in your network, then in the ComfyUI root directory right click on run_nvidia_gpu.bat open in notepad and copy and paste this overtop of what is already there.

	.\python_embeded\python.exe -s ComfyUI\main.py --windows-standalone-build --listen
	pause

## How to Run Comfy Image Workshop

1. Start your ComfyUI server by clicking on run_nvidia_gpu.bat in the `"ComfyUI_windows_portable"` directory. 

2. Open the directory where you have installed CIW and open powershell or CMD. Copy and paste this:

	.\\.venv\Scripts\activate
    python run.py

Note that this assumes your ComfyUI instance is using port 8188. If not, replace 8188 with the correct port number.

3. Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser to start using CIW.

## Tips

- Any iamges you download you can drag into comfyUI and see the workflow.
- If you change the port from 5000 to 8188 in the URL(http://127.0.0.1:5000/) you will be redirected to ComfyUI.

## QA

### Why did you make this?

I completed an online course and this is my final project. I wanted to learn how to integrate ComfyUI within a web application as well as integrate components I learned throughout the course. I expanded the scope of the project to make it easier for people who want to integrate ComfyUI in there code by making the code more modular.

### Who is this for?

Primarily for anyone that wants to learn how to code with ComfyUI and to code their own workflows.

Secondarily for the person hosting CIW to be able to share their workflows with their friends and family within their local network. On any device (computer, phone, tablet, etc)
