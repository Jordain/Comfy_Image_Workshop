WIP

## ComfyUI Installation

1. If you are on Windows and have an Nvidia GPU then you can just install the [portable version](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases/download/latest/ComfyUI_windows_portable_nvidia_cu121_or_cpu.7z)

2. Extract to your user directory(C:\Users\\%username%) and rename the directory to `ComfyUI_windows_portable_CIW`

3. If you already have git installed then right click and save link as [scripts/install-manager-for-portable-version.bat](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager/raw/main/scripts/install-manager-for-portable-version.bat) and place into `"ComfyUI_windows_portable_CIW"` directory:

4. Then double click `install-manager-for-portable-version.bat` batch file

## Comfy Image Workshop Installation

1. Install this repo in your root user directory(C:\Users\\%username%). Open command prompt and run the following:
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/Jordain/Comfy_Image_Workshop.git
```

2. Change directory to Comfy_Image_Workshop:
```commandline
cd Comfy_Image_Workshop
```

3. Then create a virtual environment:
```commandline
python -m venv .venv
```
```commandline
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

4. Install all dependencies
```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Install packages:
```commandline
npm install
```

6. If you high severity vulnerability issues, then run the following command:
```commandline
npm audit fix
```

7. Change directory to root app directory:
```commandline
cd app
```

8. Intialize the db using these three commands
```commandline
flask db init
```
```commandline
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
```
```commandline
flask db upgrade
```
9. Change directory to root:
```commandline
cd ..
```

10. To create the tailwindcss output.css file, run the following command:
```commandline
npx tailwindcss -i ./static/css/input.css -o ./static/css/output.css
```

11. To run Comfy Image Workshop, run the following command:
```commandline
python run.py
```

12. We need to allow incoming requests from the flask server and to access CIW from other devices in your network, go to your ComfyUI root directory and right click on run_nvidia_gpu.bat and open in notepad, then copy and paste this overtop of what is already there. Then Save and Close notepad. 
```notepad
.\python_embeded\python.exe -s ComfyUI\main.py --windows-standalone-build --listen
pause
```

13. (Optional) If you plan on running a new instance of ComfyUI specifically for this repo, then you might want to pass all of your checkpoints, models, loras, etc... to the new ComfyUI instance. To do this, open up ComfyUI within the ComfyUI_windows_portable directory and make a copy of extra_model_path.yaml.example and then rename it to extra_model_path.yaml. Then look for where it says comfyUI and paste the code below to replace it. Then change the the base_path to your user profile and change the ComfyUI_windows_portable to the name of your ComfyUI_windows_portable directory that has all of your checkpoints, models, loras, etc... 
```yaml
comfyui:
     base_path: C:/Users/jorda/ComfyUI_windows_portable/ComfyUI/
     checkpoints: models/checkpoints/
     clip: models/clip/
     clip_vision: models/clip_vision/
     configs: models/configs/
     controlnet: models/controlnet/
     embeddings: models/embeddings/
     loras: models/loras/
     upscale_models: models/upscale_models/
     vae: models/vae/
     ipadapter: models/ipadapter
```

## How to Run Comfy Image Workshop

1. Start your ComfyUI server by clicking on run_nvidia_gpu.bat in the `"ComfyUI_windows_portable"` directory. 

2. Open the directory where you have installed CIW and open CMD. Copy and paste this:
```commandline
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
```commandline
python run.py
```
Note that this assumes your ComfyUI instance is using port 8188. If not, replace 8188 with the correct port number.

3. Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser to start using CIW.

## Tips

- Any iamges you download you can drag into comfyUI and see the workflow.
- If you change the port from 5000 to 8188 in the URL(http://127.0.0.1:5000/) you will be redirected to ComfyUI.
- Download [SQLite Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) to view the database.

## QA

### Why did you make this?

I completed an online course and this is my final project. I wanted to learn how to integrate ComfyUI within a web application as well as integrate components I learned throughout the course. I expanded the scope of the project to make it easier for people who want to integrate ComfyUI in there code by making the code more modular.

### Who is this for?

Primarily for anyone that wants to learn how to code with ComfyUI and to code their own workflows.

Secondarily for the person hosting CIW to be able to share their workflows with their friends and family within their local network. On any device (computer, phone, tablet, etc)
